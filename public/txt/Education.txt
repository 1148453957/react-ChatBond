·  ·  Mathematics Question: What is the Fibonacci sequence? Answer: The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. (Example: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...)
·  ·  Mathematics Question: How do you calculate the area of a circle? Answer: The area AAA of a circle can be calculated using the formula A=πr2A = \pi r^2A=πr2, where rrr is the radius of the circle and π\piπ is approximately 3.14159.
·  ·  Physics Question: What is momentum? How is it calculated? Answer: Momentum ppp is the product of an object's mass mmm and its velocity vvv. It is calculated using the formula p=m⋅vp = m \cdot vp=m⋅v.
·  ·  Mathematics Question: What are prime numbers? Give an example. Answer: Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. An example is 7, as its only divisors are 1 and 7.
·  ·  Physics Question: What is Newton's Second Law of Motion? Answer: Newton's Second Law of Motion states that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass. It can be written as F=maF = maF=ma, where FFF is the net force, mmm is the mass of the object, and aaa is its acceleration.
·  ·  Mathematics Question: How do you find the volume of a rectangular prism? Answer: The volume VVV of a rectangular prism (or cuboid) can be calculated using the formula V=l×w×hV = l \times w \times hV=l×w×h, where lll is the length, www is the width, and hhh is the height.
·  ·  Mathematics Question: What is the concept of probability? Answer: Probability is a measure of the likelihood of an event occurring. It ranges from 0 (impossible) to 1 (certain). For example, the probability of flipping a coin and getting heads is 12\frac{1}{2}21​.
·  ·  Physics Question: What is work in physics? How is it calculated? Answer: Work WWW in physics is defined as the force FFF applied to an object multiplied by the distance ddd over which the force is applied in the direction of the force. It is calculated using the formula W=F⋅dW = F \cdot dW=F⋅d.
·  ·  Mathematics Question: How do you solve a proportion? Answer: To solve a proportion, cross-multiply and then solve for the variable. For example, to solve ab=cd\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}ba​=dc​, cross-multiply to get ad=bcad = bcad=bc.
·  ·  Physics Question: What is the difference between potential energy and kinetic energy? Answer: Potential energy is energy that is stored in an object due to its position or configuration (e.g., gravitational potential energy), while kinetic energy is the energy an object possesses due to its motion.
